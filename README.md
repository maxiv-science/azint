# azint: Azimuthal Integration

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/315677387.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16480726)

**azint** is a Python library for efficient azimuthal integration of area detector data.  
The integration process is transformed into a sparse matrixâ€“vector multiplication for performance.  

For increased precision, pixel splitting is done by subdividing each pixel into subpixels, assigning bins and weights to each.  
This improves the accuracy of the transformation but may introduce correlation between neighboring bins.

## ðŸ“¤ NXazint Output

To write azimuthal integration results in the [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) data format,  
you can use the [`azint_writer`](https://github.com/maxiv-science/azint_writer) package in combination with `azint`.

This enables standardized output for integration results, compatible with NeXus-based data workflows and analysis tools.
