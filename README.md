# azint: Azimuthal Integration

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/315677387.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16480726)

**azint** is a Python library for efficient azimuthal integration of area detector data.  
The integration process is transformed into a sparse matrix–vector multiplication for performance.  

For increased precision, pixel splitting is done by subdividing each pixel into subpixels, assigning bins and weights to each.  
This improves the accuracy of the transformation but may introduce correlation between neighboring bins.
